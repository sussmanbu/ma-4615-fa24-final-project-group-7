Describe the data in a few sentences/paragraphs.

The first step in the process of loading & cleaning the data was converting the tsv file we found online to an R dataset. We did so through the `read_tsv` tidyverse function, and the process went smoothly. There were no errors, unusual values, or oddly formatted data other than occasional NA values. However, after performing this initial data import, we noticed that a large majority (~90%) of the data corresponding to certain variables was missing. These included the variables  
We then decided to filter out any columns which had at least 90,000 missing values. 

not included variables:

PSTRATA because we don't know what it is & will not use it
<<<<<<< HEAD

Weight because we want to do it ourselves

SECUCODE because it relates to PSTRATA

NUM_FU_HHINT, NUM_FU_PERINT because we don't want to use the number of follow-up interviews

Variables ending with "_sub" because we are unsure what "missing  carried back from later waves " means

TIME2VIC_INC_P23PER because don't want to investigate months from PPCS interview to victimization

=======
Weight becaues we want to do it ourself
SEUCODE because it relates to PSTRAT
