Dataset Name: The Effect of Prior Police Contact on Victimization Reporting: Results From the Police-Public Contact and National Crime Victimization Surveys, United States, 2002-2011 (ICPSR 36370) [Dataset Link](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/NACJD/studies/36370/)

The data in this dataset is compiled from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) and the Police-Public Contact Survey (PPCS). Both are collected by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), which is the primary statistical agency of the US's Department of Justice. It was first established in 1979 in order to better understand statistics about crimes in the United States. The data collected in these studies provides information on how each individuals' prior interactions with law enforcement, both directly and through the experiences of others, influence their decisions to report crimes. By linking data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) with the Police-Public Contact Survey (PPCS), the researchers could explore the relationship between police encounter experiences and crime reporting behavior. The combined dataset used in this study contains data about survey participants in 2002, 2008, and 2011.

Variables common to the NCVS and PPCS were concatenated to create unique identifiers which could link the two datasets, but there was variation across different years in how much of the data that could be linked. For example, due to a switch in study design, only about 15% of participants who took the both surveys in 2011 could be included in the combined dataset.
Another issue arises from the unequal weight of data of people within differing segments of the population. Because not all PPCS interviews could be matched, population estimates are not necessarily representative of the U.S. population, even though both of the original studies were designed to be representative.
Additionally, since this dataset relies on responses to both of these surveys, it is possible that the sample is biased to include more individuals who experienced victimization at the hand of law enforcement, as they may be more likely to respond to the NCVS versus those who may not have.

The dataset provides detailed crime data in the U.S. and is used to inform policy-making decisions. Law enforcement agencies, policymakers, and researchers. These groups use this data to identify crime trends, allocate resources, and develop crime prevention strategies.
