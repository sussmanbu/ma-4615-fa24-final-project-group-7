"Where does the data come from?"

"Who collected it?"

"Why was it collected?"

"Are you able to find the data from the original source?"

"Are there any issues you can see with how the data was collected?"
Issues with how the data was collected: The NCVS and PPCS do not contain common identifiers that would allow cases to be linked across datasets. Variables common to the NCVS and PPCS were concatenated to create unique identifiers which could link the two datasets, but there was variation in how much the data had to be manipulated to create these unique identifiers. This method was also used to generate unique identifiers for approximately 77 to 90 percent of PPCS cases depending on the year, the rest of them being generated by manipulating the sampling weights and using the person sequence number.
Additionally, when multiple incidents of the same type occurred in the same month and were the first incidents subsequent to the PPCS, it was impossible to determine which incident was most proximal to PPCS interview, so the first incident was selected at random, affecting 39 (.6%) of the personal incidents and 443 (3.9%) of the respondents with household incidents. 
Another issue is with the weights:  not all PPCS interviews could be matched, therefore population estimates are not necessarily representative of the U.S. population. Also, 2011 cases have higher weights due to sampling design, and thus have a disproportionate effect on the results.
"What is the sample population?"
The sample population is 105,273 people ages 16 and older living in the United States.

"Are there reasons to think the sample is biased in some way?"

"How is this data used? Has there been other research on the same data?"

"Is this data being used for some policy decisions?"

"What questions have others ask about this data?"
