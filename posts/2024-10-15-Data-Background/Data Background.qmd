Dataset Name: The Effect of Prior Police Contact on Victimization Reporting: Results From the Police-Public Contact and National Crime Victimization Surveys, United States, 2002-2011 (ICPSR 36370) [Dataset Link](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/NACJD/studies/36370/)

The data in this dataset is compiled from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) and the Police-Public Contact Survey (PPCS). Both are collected by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), which is the primary statistical agency of the US's Department of Justice. It was first established in 1979 in order to better understand statistics about crimes in the United States. The study collected this data to investigate how individuals' prior interactions with law enforcement, both directly and through the experiences of others, influence their decisions to report crimes. By linking data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) with the Police-Public Contact Survey (PPCS), the researchers could explore the relationship between these experiences and crime reporting behavior.

Variables common to the NCVS and PPCS were concatenated to create unique identifiers which could link the two datasets, but there was variation in how much the data had to be manipulated to create them.
Another issue is with the weights:  not all PPCS interviews could be matched, therefore population estimates are not necessarily representative of the U.S. population. Due to the means that the dataset was collected, it is susceptible to inherit bias found in the sample that is collected. Since this dataet relies on responses to both of these surveys it is possible that the sample is biased in that individuals who experienced victimization at the hand of law enforcement may be more likely to respond to the NCVS versus those who may not have.

The dataset provides detailed crime data in the U.S. and is used in policy-making decisions. Law enforcement agencies, policymakers, and researchers use NIBRS data to identify crime trends, allocate resources, and develop crime prevention strategies.
