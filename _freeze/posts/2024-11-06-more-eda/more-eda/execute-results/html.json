We studied the disparities in experiences of improper police contact among different racial groups. We made a bar plot to illustrate the proportion within each racial group who reported experiencing improper police contact and the result reveals notable differences across racial groups.This insight lays the groundwork for deeper analysis to understand what factors contribute to these differences, potentially using demographic and situational variables in further modeling.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidymodels))\ndata <- readRDS(\"dataset/police_interaction.rds\") \ndata |>\n  filter(!is.na(PROPER)) |>\n  group_by(RACE) |>\n  summarize(\n    improper_proportion = sum(PROPER == 0) / n()\n  ) |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, y = improper_proportion, fill = RACE)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](more-eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThis is the second plot that we would like to include here: \nWe made a heatmap that visualizes the correlations between various continuous variables in the dataset, where the color intensity represents the strength and direction of the correlation (with red indicating positive correlations and blue indicating negative correlations). There are notable positive correlations such as HHPOV and WORK_LW and notable negative correlations such as WORK_LW and any high-income indicator.\nThis heatmap helps identify groups of continuous variables that may be related or unrelated, which can be useful in modeling and to understand relationships among the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(reshape2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'reshape2'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tidyr':\n\n    smiths\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Categorizing variables based on their types\n#removed \"CONTACT\" and \"ERROR\" due to \"Warning in cor(numeric_data, use = \"complete.obs\") : the standard deviation is zero\" error\nbinary_columns <- c(\"MALE\", \"WORK_LW\", \"HHPOV\", \"PUB_HOUSE\",   \"PUB_HOUSE_SUB\", \"REGION\", \"INPERSON\", \"VICAR_CITIZEN\", \"VICAR_PRO_AUTO\", \"VICAR_PRO_PERS\", \"VICAR_OTH_CONT\", \"VICAR_IMPROPER\", \"D_HH_P23\", \"PROPER\")\n\nordinal_columns <- c(\"C4_RACE\", \"MAR_STAT\", \"FREQ_DRV\", \"TENURE\",  \"MSA_STATUS\")\n\ncontinuous_columns <- c(\"AGE\", \"EDUCATION\", \"EDUCATION_SUB\", \"NUM_MOVES\", \"NUM_CONT\", \"HH_SIZE\", \"PPCS_YEAR\", \"N_HH_P1\", \"N_PERS_P1\", \"NUM_CITIZEN_HH\", \"NUM_PRO_AUTO_HH\", \"NUM_PRO_PERS_HH\", \"NUM_OTH_CONT_HH\", \"NUM_IMPROPER_HH\")\n\nfiltered <- data\n# Selecting data by type\nbinary_data <- filtered %>%\n  select(all_of(binary_columns)) %>%\n  select(where(is.numeric))\n\nordinal_data <- filtered %>%\n  select(all_of(ordinal_columns)) %>%\n  select(where(is.numeric))\n\ncontinuous_data <- filtered %>%\n  select(all_of(continuous_columns)) %>%\n  select(where(is.numeric))\n\n# Calculating correlation matrices with appropriate methods\ncor_binary <- cor(binary_data, use = \"pairwise.complete.obs\", method = \"pearson\")\ncor_ordinal <- cor(ordinal_data, use = \"pairwise.complete.obs\", method = \"spearman\")\ncor_continuous <- cor(continuous_data, use = \"pairwise.complete.obs\", method = \"pearson\")\n\n# Creating a heatmap function\nplot_heatmap <- function(cor_matrix, title) {\n  cor_melted <- melt(cor_matrix)\n  ggplot(cor_melted, aes(Var1, Var2, fill = value)) +\n    geom_tile(color = \"white\") +\n    scale_fill_gradient2(low = \"blue\", high = \"red\", mid = \"white\",\n                         midpoint = 0, limit = c(-1, 1), name = \"Correlation\") +\n    labs(title = title, x = \"Variables\", y = \"Variables\") +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1),\n          axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 1))\n}\n\n# Plotting heatmaps for each correlation matrix\nif (ncol(continuous_data) > 1) {\n  print(plot_heatmap(cor_continuous, \"Correlation Heatmap of Continuous Variables\"))\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](more-eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFor modeling, we used a linear model to try to predict whether someone would be arrested based on their race, years of education, if their household is living in poverty, and their gender.
