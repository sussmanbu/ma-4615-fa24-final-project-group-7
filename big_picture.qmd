### Introduction

We often see headlines and news articles outlining the racial discrimination that minorities across the United States of America face each and every day. Many movements throughout our country's history relate to these issues; specifically, we saw the Black Lives Matter movement of 2020 bring into question the issue of police treatment towards minority individuals. This begs us to ask the question, are police really racist? Do they approach situations involving minorities professionally? Or do they have to be stricter in these regions which face higher rates of violent crime? This study takes a deep dive into the correlation between police satisfaction rates, racial demographics, and the violent crime rates across the different regions of America to answer those questions.

### Analysis Results
Through our analysis we found a significant correlation between multiple different factors and their likelihood to be treated properly during an interaction with the police.

During this analysis we did indeed find that there was a strong correlation between a person's race and their likelihood of both experiencing improper police behavior and being arrested by police during a given encounter. This was alongside a number of other variables which found that males of Black Non-Hispanic descent, with little education, living with lower annual income are the individuals with the highest likelihood of being arrested by the police.

We also found that regions with higher populations of the Black Non-Hispanic demographic faced slightly higher rates of firearm homicide when compared to their counterparts. However, our predictive model based on the combined dataset for firearm homicide and police behavior was not able to predict improper police behavior for respondents of any particular race or from any particular region.

While the outlined factors, like race, education, income, and gender, may be strong predictors of things like homicide or arrest rates we must be sure to not label them as causes for these things. 

Even though it may be true that some police are racist, or that certain individuals are more prone to violence, its untrue to make these blanket statements about all individuals of extremely large groups across the United States. Despite the fact that certain races are more likely to be arrested, or are associated with higher rates of gun violence does not denote that police are inherently racist, or that certain races are inherently more violent.

In contrast these conclusions may point out certain flaws in our Nations allocation of resources, leaving certain groups of individuals more susceptible to certain situations in their lifetime. In many cases, individuals without a high level of education or income are put in more extreme circumstances that could push them to find alternative modes of sustaining their own needs. These life circumstances could force some of these individuals to make more extreme decisions leading them to have higher rates of crime and subsequently incarceration/detainment.

This issue of racial injustice in our country stems far beyond the surface cause of racism, but finds its roots in deep traditions of our country. Individuals of certain racial demographics or income levels often find themselves trapped in a cycle of poverty, and find themselves stuck in a life that leads to these unfortunate situations we often find ourselves reading about on the news. Finding ways to eliminate social injustice in our county is a challenge for all individuals to face together, regardless of our own personal life stories.

### Interactive Plot
This interactive scatter plot shows the Firearm Homicide Rate relative to racial proportions of the 4 regions. Most of the firearm homicides took place in the South, with similar firearm homicide rate in the Midwest and Northeast, and the lowest rate of firearm homicides in the West. Looking at the different scatter plots, we observed that regions with more minorities had higher firearm homicide rate, which could be related to the higher proportion of improper police behavior reported by minorities than by non-minorities.

```

Each racial group (e.g., White NH, Black NH, Hispanic, Other/Multi NH) displays distinct trends in their proportions relative to firearm homicide rates. For example, the "White NH" plot shows consistently high racial proportions but relatively low firearm homicide rates across all regions and years, while the "Black NH" plot reflects lower racial proportions with higher firearm homicide rates, especially in the South. The "Hispanic" and "Other/Multi NH" groups show intermediate trends with lower racial proportions and moderate firearm homicide rates, particularly in the West and South. Regional variation is evident, with the South generally displaying higher firearm homicide rates across all groups. This visualization highlights the relationship between racial demographics and firearm homicide rates, with disparities likely reflecting broader socioeconomic and systemic factors.

The second interactive plot provides an interactive map visualization that displays regional statistics as well as racial statistics for selected years (2002, 2008, 2011). Readers can select a year from the sidebar to dynamically filter and display data for that specific year.
