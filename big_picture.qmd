We often see headlines and news articles outlining the racial discrimination that minorities across America face each and every day. There have many multiple movements throughout the history of our country relating to these issues. Specifically we saw the Black Lives Matter movement of 2020 bring into question the issue of police treatment towards minority individuals. This begs us to ask the question, are police really racist? Do they approach situations involving minorities professionally?

### Introduction


### Interactive Plot
This interactive scatter plot shows the Firearm Homicide Rate relative to racial proportions of the 4 regions. Most of the firearm homicides took place in the South, with similar firearm homicide rate in the Midwest and Northeast, and the lowest rate of firearm homicides in the West. Looking at the different scatter plots, we observed that regions with more minorities had higher firearm homicide rate, which could be related to the higher proportion of improper police behavior reported by minorities than by non-minorities.
